1. AIOps is a tool to automate and enhance the field of IT. It is basically used to improve IT infrastructure using big data, advanced analytics and ML. 
The amount is data processed today is huge to say the least. That's where AIOps comes in. It helps select useful data to automate, perform root cause analysis and prevent anomalies. <br />
MLOps on the other hand is an approach to managing ML algorithms as ongoing products, each with its own continuous lifecycle. 
It aims to build, scale, and deploy algorithms to production consistently. A basic distinction would be that AIOps automates machines while MLOps standardizes processes. <br />

2. An interpretable model is basically one that can be explained. An interpretable linear regression model is one in which we have an explanation about the model's weights.
The interpretation depends on features. The types of features are: Numerical, Binary, Categorical and Intercept.
The importance of a feature in a linear regression model can be measured by the absolute value of its t-statistic, which is the estimated weight scaled with its standard error.
Importance of a feature increases with increasing weight. The more variance the estimated weight has (= the less certain we are about the correct value), the less important the feature is. <br />

3. Automated Machine Learning provides methods and processes to make ML available for non-ML experts, to improve efficiency and to accelerate research on ML.
It is the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of model development. <br />
In MLOps, AutoML can be used for hyperparameter tuning, pre and post processing and other optimization tasks (accelerate MLOps and improve efficiency). <br />
A few AutoML systems are Auto-PyTorch, AutoKeras, Auto-sklearn and Auto-WEKA. SMAC3 and DEHB are two HPO (Hyperparameter optimization) packages.
